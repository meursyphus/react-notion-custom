# Description of Changes

Here is reference: #25

---

## support 'custom your created block' block

- Please add **the block you created** to replace the 'crate' block.

- ex) add react-katex dependency to support equation block
  -> **add custom solution for rendering 'your custom block'**

## Review point

- ex) Instead of adding the react-katex dependency, should I create a custom solution specifically for this project?
  -> **Should we integrate an existing solution or use a custom implementation for 'your custom block'?**

## To reproduce

- npm run story:start
- click 'your created block' on the Storybook left side panel

## Screenshot

- A screenshot of your created block being rendered in Storybook.
