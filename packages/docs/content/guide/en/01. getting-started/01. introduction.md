# Introduction to React-Notion-Custom Project

## What is React-Notion-Custom?

React-Notion-Custom is a tool that allows you to easily bring Notion's powerful content creation capabilities to your website. This library enables you to render content created in Notion directly on your React-based website. It's a "magic potion" for both developers and content creators - allowing developers to quickly produce results and providing content creators with a convenient management tool. ✨

## Key Features and Provided Value

### 🛠️ React Rendering of Notion Data

You can easily convert various content from Notion such as text, images, lists, code blocks, etc., into React components. Notion pages are reborn on the web with the following structure:

```jsx
import { Notion, type NotionPageData } from 'react-notion-custom';

interface NotionPageProps {
  pageData: NotionPageData;
}

function NotionPage({ pageData }: NotionPageProps) {
  return (
    <Notion>
      <Notion.Cover src={pageData.cover} />
      <Notion.Body>
        <Notion.Title title={pageData.title} />
        <Notion.Blocks blocks={pageData.blocks} />
      </Notion.Body>
    </Notion>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `NotionPageData` type defines the data structure of a Notion page. This allows you to use TypeScript's type checking feature to write more stable code.

### 🎨 Freedom of Customization

You can easily change themes by just tweaking CSS, or partially modify the provided components to customize only the parts you need. You can even create completely new components and combine them with React-Notion-Custom. It offers unlimited possibilities for developers who handle code.

### 🚀 Rapid Site Construction

You can easily extract Notion data using the Notion-dump CLI and quickly build static sites through frameworks like Next.js. The process of building a site with just a few commands feels like a website is completed right from the text.

```bash
npx notion-dump --page YOUR_PAGE_URL --auth YOUR_API_KEY
```

When you run notion-dump, Notion data is extracted into the following folder structure:

```
my-notion-project/
├── notion-data/
│   ├── page-slug-1.json
│   ├── page-slug-2.json
│   └── ...
└── public/
    └── images/
        ├── page-slug-1/
        │   ├── image1.png
        │   └── image2.jpg
        ├── page-slug-2/
        │   └── image1.png
        └── ...
```

- `notion-data/`: The content of each Notion page is stored in JSON format. The file name is generated based on the page's slug.
- `public/images/`: Images used in Notion pages are stored and categorized by each page.

The extracted data can be easily integrated with React-Notion-Custom components, allowing you to quickly convert Notion content into a website. By simply passing the content of the JSON file to React components, the structure and style of the Notion page are reflected directly on the website.
