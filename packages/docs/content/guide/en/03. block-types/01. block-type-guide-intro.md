# Introduction to Block Type Guide

React-Notion-Custom supports various block types from Notion, providing components that closely resemble Notion's style for each block type. This guide explains the currently supported block types, the Props for each block type, customization methods, and internal working principles.

## Supported Block Types

Here's a list of block types currently supported and planned for support in React-Notion-Custom:

This list will be continuously updated, and we plan to support more block types in the future.

## Using Props

React-Notion-Custom provides Props types for each block type. These Props types can be imported directly from the library for use.

For example, the Props for the Paragraph component can be imported and used as follows:

```typescript
import { ParagraphProps } from "react-notion-custom";

// Structure of ParagraphProps
interface ParagraphProps {
  type: "paragraph";
  paragraph: {
    rich_text: Array<RichTextItemResponse>;
    color: string;
  };
  id: string;
  has_children?: boolean;
}

// Usage example
const MyParagraph: React.FC<ParagraphProps> = (props) => {
  // Custom implementation
};
```

Detailed structures of Props for each block type can be found in the respective block type documentation.

## Applying Custom Components

One of the major advantages of React-Notion-Custom is the ability to completely replace each block type with custom components. Here's how to apply custom components:

```jsx
import { Notion } from "react-notion-custom";
import CustomParagraph from "./CustomParagraph";
import CustomHeading from "./CustomHeading";

const customComponents = {
  paragraph: CustomParagraph,
  heading_1: CustomHeading,
  heading_2: CustomHeading,
  heading_3: CustomHeading,
  // ... custom components for other block types
};

function MyNotionPage({ blocks }) {
  return (
    <Notion custom={customComponents}>
      <Notion.Blocks blocks={blocks} />
    </Notion>
  );
}
```

The type of `components` injected into the `Notion` component is as follows:

```typescript
type NotionComponents = Record<string, React.ComponentType<any>>;
```

Here, `key` is the type of Notion block (e.g., 'paragraph', 'heading_1', etc.), and `value` is the React component that will render that type.

## Data Preprocessing

React-Notion-Custom preprocesses block data fetched from the Notion API into a form optimized for UI rendering. In this process, it defines and uses a new type called `ContextedBlock`.

```
+----------------------+
|    Notion API        |
|    Block Data        |
| +------------------+ |
| | Block            | |
| | - id             | |
| | - type           | |
| | - has_children   | |
| | - [type_specific]| |
| +------------------+ |
+----------------------+
           |
           | (Input)
           v
+---------------------------+
| resolveToContextedBlocks  |
| +-------------------------+
| | For each block:         |
| | +---------------------+ |
| | |resolveToContextedBlo| |
| | |ck (recursive)       | |
| | +---------------------+ |
| |   |                     |
| |   v                     |
| | Map parent-child        |
| | relationships           |
| +-------------------------+
|   |
|   v
| Map sibling relationships |
+---------------------------+
           |
           | (Output)
           v
+---------------------------+
|     ContextedBlocks       |
| +-------------------------+
| | ContextedBlock          |
| | - ...Block properties   |
| | - context:              |
| |   - previous (sibling)  |
| |   - next (sibling)      |
| |   - parent              |
| | - blocks (children)     |
| +-------------------------+
+---------------------------+
           |
           | (Used by)
           v
    +----------------+
    | Notion.Blocks  |
    | Component      |
    +----------------+
```

`ContextedBlock` extends the existing `Block` type to include the following additional information:

- Previous block (sibling relationship)
- Next block (sibling relationship)
- Parent block

This additional information can be useful in specific block components.

## Rendering Process

The rendering process of React-Notion-Custom is as follows:

```
+-------------------+      +------------------+
|   Custom          |      |   Default        |
|   Components      |      |   Components     |
+-------------------+      +------------------+
          |                         |
          |   +-----------------+   |
          +-->|     Notion      |<--+
              |    Component    |
              |(React.Provider) |
              +-----------------+
                    |     |
         +----------+     +------------+
         |                             |
+----------------+             +----------------+
| Notion.Cover   |             | Notion.Body    |
+----------------+             +----------------+
                                       |
                               +----------------+
                               | Notion.Title   |
                               +----------------+
                                       |
                               +----------------+
                               | Notion.Blocks  |
                               +----------------+
                                       |
                                       v
                               +----------------+
                               | Rendered       |
                               | Notion Page    |
                               +----------------+
```

Through this process, custom components and default components work together to render the Notion page.

## Styling

The currently provided Notion components are implemented to closely resemble Notion's style. Each component is styled using CSS classes with the `notion-` prefix.

## Future Plans

- Add support for more block types
- Develop component sets with applied themes
- Expand advanced customization options

In the following pages, you can find detailed descriptions, Props structures, usage examples, and customization options for each block type.
