# Quote Block

The Quote block is used to display text quoted from another source. It is typically represented in a visually distinct style.

## Data Structure

The Notion API data structure for a Quote block is as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "quote",
  "quote": {
    "rich_text": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": {
          "content": "This is a quote",
          "link": null
        },
        "annotations": {
          "bold": false,
          "italic": false,
          "strikethrough": false,
          "underline": false,
          "code": false,
          "color": "default"
        },
        "plain_text": "This is a quote",
        "href": null
      }
    ],
    "color": "default"
  }
}
```

- `rich_text`: An array containing the text content and style information of the quote.
- `color`: Specifies the color of the quote.

## React Component

The component that renders the Quote block in React-Notion-Custom is as follows:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import type { QuoteArgs } from "../types";
import { getColorCss } from "../utils";
import RichText from "./internal/rich-text";

type QuoteProps = {
  children?: React.ReactNode;
} & QuoteArgs;

const Quote: React.FC<QuoteProps> = ({ children, ...props }) => {
  const {
    quote: { color, rich_text: texts },
  } = props;

  return (
    <div className={`notion-block notion-quote ${getColorCss(color)}`}>
      <div className="notion-quote-content">
        <p>
          <RichText props={texts} />
        </p>
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Quote;
```

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use the Quote block:

```jsx
import { Notion } from "react-notion-custom";

function MyNotionPage({ blocks }) {
  return (
    <Notion>
      <Notion.Blocks blocks={blocks} />
    </Notion>
  );
}
```

Here, `blocks` is an array of block data received from the Notion API.

## Styling

The style of the Quote block can be customized through the following CSS classes:

- `.notion-block`: Basic style applied to all Notion blocks
- `.notion-quote`: Specific style for Quote blocks
- `.notion-quote-content`: Style for the content of the quote

If additional styling is needed, you can write CSS targeting these classes. Typically, Quote blocks have the following style characteristics:

- Thick border on the left or both sides
- Slight indentation
- Changed background color
- Changed font style (e.g., italics)

For example, you can apply the following CSS:

```css
.notion-quote {
  border-left: 4px solid #ccc;
  padding-left: 16px;
  margin-left: 0;
  margin-right: 0;
  font-style: italic;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
}
```

## Nesting Support

Quote blocks can contain other blocks. This is handled through the `children` prop. For example, you can include lists or other text blocks within a quote.

## Notes

- Quote blocks are generally used for short quotations. For longer quotes, it might be better to split them into multiple Quote blocks for readability.
- It's good practice to specify the source of the quote. This can be added as a separate Paragraph block below the Quote block.
- For accessibility, it's recommended to add appropriate ARIA attributes for screen reader users. For example, you can use the `role="blockquote"` attribute.
